Feature: Backlog Sprints
  In order to start iterating and producing the stories from my backlog
  A user
  Should be able to manage and assign stories within sprints

  Background:
    Given a user named "John" is registered
      And I am signed in as "John"
      And the database has the necessary lookup tables
      And an account called "Acme" is set up for "John"
